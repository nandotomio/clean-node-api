# **Clean Node API**

This API project is part a course provided by professor Rodrigo Manguinho (Mango) at Udemy.

The purpose of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using:
* TDD (test-oriented programming) as the working methodology
* Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers
* SOLID principles
* Design Patterns to solve some common problems

> ## APIs built in training
